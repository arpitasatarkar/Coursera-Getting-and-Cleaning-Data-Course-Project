# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The repository includes a R code created for analyzing data obtained for Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone.

The data description can be obtained from the link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

To be able to run this code we need to obtain data from link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Once you have the data in your working directory you can simply import the run_analysis.R code to obtain the tidy_dataset_with_average.txt dataset as excepted in Step 5 of the project.

The CodeBook.md describes the variables referred to in the code.
